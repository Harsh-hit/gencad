# gencad: AI-Powered CAD Drawing Generation

## Overview
Gencad is an AI-powered system designed to generate CAD drawings automatically based on a provided example image and a text prompt. Using generative AI, this tool streamlines the process of creating CAD drawings, reducing the manual effort involved in designing complex structures.

## Target Features
- **Image-based Generation**: Upload an example image to guide the AI in producing CAD drawings with similar structural elements.
- **Prompt-based Control**: Use a text prompt to specify additional design requirements, enabling tailored output based on your needs.

## To-do list:
1. Create a system to to integrate commands generated by Gencad to AutoCad.
2. Fine Tune a model with appropriate Dataset and compare with state of the art model
3. Find metrics to benchmark models
