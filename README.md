# gencad: AI-Powered CAD Drawing Generation

## Overview

Gencad is an AI-powered system designed to generate CAD drawings automatically based on a provided example image and a text prompt. Using generative AI, this tool streamlines the process of creating CAD drawings, reducing the manual effort involved in designing complex structures.

## Target Features

-   **Image-based Generation**: Upload an example image to guide the AI in producing CAD drawings with similar structural elements.
-   **Prompt-based Control**: Use a text prompt to specify additional design requirements, enabling tailored output based on your needs.

## To-do list:

1. Create a system to to integrate commands generated by Gencad to AutoCad.
2. Fine Tune a model with appropriate Dataset and compare with state of the art models
3. Find metrics to benchmark models

## Setup Steps:

1. Create a new folder and clone the repository
2. Create a python virtual environment using the following command.
    - python -m venv envname
3. Activate the env and install all the requirements using the command:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Create a .env file in the parent directory and add the following variable.
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOURKEY"
5. Run the commands.py script.
